Note: Some "flags" do not require answers as they are steps in a process. Flag numbers are tied to appropriate steps in my write up.

Flag #3: What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server (enter name without /)?
Answer: development
Method: Used dirbuster to discover directory

Flag #5: What is the username?
Answer: jan
Method: Used "enum4linux -a <ip>", since target had smb share active

Flag #6: What is the password?
Answer: armando
Method: Used hydra to brute force jan login creds via ssh, used rockyou.txt password list

Flag #7: What service do you use to access the server (answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
Answer: SSH

Flag #9: What is the name of the other user you found (all lower case)?
Answer: kay
Method: Referred back to enum4linux results

Flag #11: What is the final password you obtain?
Answer: heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
Method: Found SSH private key in /home/kay/.ssh/. It was password protected, so I used ssh2john and then used john the ripper with rockyou.txt to get the ssh key password "beeswax". From there, I could log in and get the answer in the users home directory.
